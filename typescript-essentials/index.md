## Reflections

- Learn how TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript for web development. Install TypeScript and Set up a TypeScript project.
- Learn TypeScript types like primitives, objects, and how to correct use them. Helps to better understand js types.
- Learn what is interface in TypeScript. How to combinate them. Helps easier understand OOP in future.
- Learn benefits of using types in functions, more about interface and type aliases. This helps to make scalable function arguments.
- Learn benefits of using classes, learn about class constructor, methods, properties. This helps me to better understand OOP, and write clean reusable code in future.
- Learn about genericss, and difference any and generic. This helps to provide type checking if i want creating reusable and flexible components.

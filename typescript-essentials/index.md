# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/into0-4612/achievements/n7978acf)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/into0-4612/achievements/hygrv5z8)

## Reflections

- Learn how TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript for web development. Install TypeScript and Set up a TypeScript project.
- Learn TypeScript types like primitives, objects, and how to correct use them. Helps to better understand js types.

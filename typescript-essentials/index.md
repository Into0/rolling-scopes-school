## Reflections

- Learned how TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript for web development. How to install TypeScript and set up a TypeScript project.
- Learned TypeScript types like primitives, objects, and how to correct use them. Helps to better understand js types.
- Learned what is interface in TypeScript. How to combinate them. Helps easier understand OOP in future.
- Learned benefits of using types in functions, more about interface and type aliases. This helps to make scalable function arguments.
- Learned benefits of using classes, learn about class constructor, methods, properties. This helps me to better understand OOP, and write clean reusable code in future.
- Learned about genericss, and difference any and generic. This helps to provide type checking if i want creating reusable and flexible components.
- Learned how to organize code using modules, integrate and utilize external libraries in TypeScript projects. This helps to split code to diferrent files for for easy maintace, this also stick to DRY principles.
- Learned about namespaces, how to use them and difference about modules, this help me to write reusable, also for new project need to choice somthing one namespaces or modules, because dont recomends to use both.
